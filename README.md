<h5 align="left">Description</h5>
<p>Subscription-based businesses place a significant emphasis on mitigating customer churn, making it a key strategic focus. In this Power BI portfolio project, we delve into a dataset derived from a hypothetical telecom company named Databel to conduct a comprehensive analysis of churn rates. Beyond merely quantifying churn rates, our objective is to discern the underlying reasons for customer churn and devise effective strategies for reduction. Through the creation of impactful measures, calculated columns, and visually engaging report pages, we aim to provide actionable insights into the factors influencing churn and propose solutions to enhance customer retention. This project showcases not only the analytical capabilities of Power BI but also the ability to translate data-driven findings into meaningful business strategies, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of sustaining and growing customer relationships within a subscription-based model.</p>
